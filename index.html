    <h3>Welcome to an online adaptation of the 1954 board game, <i>Marlin Perkins'... ZOO PARADE.</i></h3>
    
    <p>Marlin Perkins was a 1950s celebrity who turned the experience of zoo work into a television spectacle. With his first television show <i> Zoo Parade</i> (1945-1955), Perkins familiarized American audiences with animals at the Lincoln Park Zoo.  Perkins went on to create the TV show <i>Mutual of Omaha's Wild Kingdom</i>(1963-1984), which showcased wildlife. This board game was designed to be educational, teaching players about the diet and habits of wild animals.</p>

<p>Now, playing the board game offers a window into the 20th century American animal trade: how animals were tracked, captured, and transported back to zoos.
