		This online board game is an adaptation of the original 1954 board game, <i>Marlin Perkins&rsquo;... ZOO PARADE</i>. Marlin Perkins was a celebrity during the 1950s, as he turned the experience of zoo work into a television spectacle. With his first television show <i>Zoo Parade</i> in 1945-1955, Perkins familiarized American audiences with animals at the Lincoln Park Zoo. Perkins would go on to create <i>Mutual of Omaha&rsquo;s Wild Kingdom</i> from 1963-1984, which showcased wildlife and nature on television. The board game, just like the zoo, is supposed to be educational. There are numerous questions pertaining to each animal&rsquo;s habitat and diet, so players can become knowledgeable about the animals. More importantly though, playing the board game can give us a window into understanding the animal trade during the 20th century. The board game reflects the animals trade as it teaches players how to track wild animals, what signs to look for, and what method to use when capturing the animal. It also requires players to consider the method of transportation of faraway animals back to the American zoo. By clicking on interactive links throughout the game, players will also learn much more about the animal trade and American zoos through the analysis of Professor and Historian Daniel Bender, who analyzes the development of modern zoos in his newest book.
