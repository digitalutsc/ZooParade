    <h3>Welcome to an online adaptation of the 1954 board game, <i>Marlin Perkins' ZOO PARADE.*</i></h3>
    
    <p>Marlin Perkins was a celebrity who turned the experience of zoo work into a television spectacle. With his first television show <i> Zoo Parade</i> (1945-1955), Perkins familiarized American audiences with animals at the Lincoln Park Zoo.  Perkins went on to create the TV show <i>Mutual of Omaha's Wild Kingdom</i>(1963-1984), which showcased wildlife. This board game was designed to be educational, teaching players about the diet and habits of wild animals.</p>

<p>Playing the board game now offers a window into the 20th century American animal trade: how animals were tracked, captured, and transported back to zoos. <a href="play_game.html">Play the game</a> and read analysis by Professor and Historian Daniel Bender, author of <a href="http://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674737341"> "The Animal Game: Searching for Wildness at the American Zoo"</a></p>
