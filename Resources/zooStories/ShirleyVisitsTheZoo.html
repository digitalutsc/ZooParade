<h2>Shirley Visits the Zoo (1951)</h2>

<p>In 1951, Shirley's dad worked for the phone company. On weekend mornings, Shirley got up very early and went hand in hand with her father to the local zoo. Sometimes she asked her dad to buy her a snack, and then her "animal friends" would help her eat the peanuts. Occasionally, the keepers lifted Shirley over the fence to enjoy rare intimacy with the animals.</p>

Shirley was in all her politeness and cuteness, fictional.  </div> 


<p>Shirley was the little heroine of a children's book written by Belle Benchley, the executive secretary of the San Diego Zoo. She published Shirley Visits the Zoo to reintroduce the zoo to its most desired visitors: children. Five years later, the San Diego Zoo joined many other large and mid-sized American zoos in constructing a children's zoo.</p>

<p>More than ever before, the postwar American zoo catered to its young visitors. The young crowds enjoyed displays borrowed from nursery rhymes or bible stories. Children were allowed to pet domestic animals in farm scenes. Even rare animals babies, like tigers, were on display at children's zoos. For example, the San Diego's children's zoo boasted of lion cubs for kids to pet.</p>

<p> "Your youngster," the San Diego Zoo told parents, "can learn much through intimate contact with animal life." </p>

<p>Children's zoos were more than a new innovation, because zoo babies and human children shared the bonds of family life, and the children's zoo seemed to validate this connection. </p>

<p>The animal families displayed in children's zoos stressed the similarities between animal motherhood and human motherhood, and the idealized human family structure in general.</p>

<p>For women who were eager to find work at zoos, the children's zoo was often the only opportunity for paid zoo work. The position of zookeeper had been an almost exclusively male occupation until the 1950s and 1960s. However as zoos started to focus more on breeding, the nurturing and mothering qualities popularly associated with women were seen by zoo managers as particularly valuable assets when dealing with animal babies. When Shirley went to the zoo, women were finding their way into a formally dominated male zoo workplace. </p>
