<h2>The Chimp-napping of Mr. Moke (1959-1961)</h2>


<p>In 1959, visits in St. Louis were excited to see the new famous chimpanzee star: Mr. Moke.</p>

<p>Then, Moke was chimp-napped. The story began with Robert Tomarchin, the Florida animal trader, decided to sell Mr. Moke to the St. Louis Zoo. However, Tomarchin soon had misgivings about the sale and snuck back into the zoo at night to steal Mr. Moke back. At least he left a note in the chimpanzee's cage when he took him. "Mr. Moke is a sub-human child in need of all the love and care due," Tomarchin explained. Soon Mr. Moke and his trainer were on the run and were being hunted by the FBI. Still, Americans might have seen the famous chimpanzee and not even have realized it. After the chimp-napping, Tomarchin rented out Mr. Moke under a false name for the filming of "Bell Hop," starring Jerry Lewis.</p>

<p>A chimpâ€“napping was an American first. But what does the crime and the trial that followed tell us about the relationships, loving and tense, that connected animals and their trainers?</p>

<p>Born in the Belgian Congo and civilized in Florida, Mr. Moke arrived in St. Louis when he was just three years old. He was destined to be the zoo's next great ape star, before he was chimp-napped.</p>

<p>As the FBI joined in a nationwide chimp-hunt, the media portrayed the "love" that linked Mr. Moke and his former owner. They ate, slept, swam, showered, and dined out together. They even kissed for the newspaper photographers.</p>

<p>"Bob and Moke lived for each other," noted their friend Gertrude Lintz, herself a famed primate owner and trainer.</p>

<p>Yet how could a court, a trainer, and a zoo measure chimp love? The evidence of affection lay in Moke's anthropoid acts, not in any effort to document the chimpanzee's more natural behavior. Tomarchin claimed that Moke shared his dream of living together on their "own little island." As proof, he offered evidence of their intimate domesticity. The standard acts of the vaudeville stage replayed as domestic harmony when Mr. Moke and Tomarchin shared dinner. Mr. Moke preferred his steaks, pork, and chicken "well-done," said Tomarchin, even if chimpanzees are mostly vegetarian.</p>

<p>Finally tracked down and on trial, Tomarchin could only protest that Mr. Moke needed him, and the sale was a mistake. After a jury trial and a last effort by Tomarchin to flee the country with Mr. Moke, the star chimp was returned to the zoo. Tomarchin surrendered and the court placed him on parole. Mr. Moke, meanwhile, skipped the cages of the primate house and began a whole new human relationship. He went to live with Mike Kostial, the zoo's chimpanzee trainer and his family, much to the delight of local reporters eager to document the life of the famous chimp. In Kostial's St. Louis home, Mr. Moke sat at the table, watched television, and raided the refrigerator for cookies. The only difference between the chimpanzee and the "human child" was Moke's after-dinner cigarette.</p>

<p>The kiss, grin, hug, and domestic bliss all became part of demonstrating the intimate ties of animals, especially apes, and people. Signs of chimp pleasure were particularly important. This was why Tomarchin and the zoo traded accusations of cruelty and beating. For example, the zoo claimed that Tomarchin had knocked out Mr. Moke's two front teeth. The chimpanzee's broken front teeth offer a very telling story: some chimps agreed to their training and relished its rewards, others resisted. Nevertheless for reporters and their cameras, Kostial gazed, like a proud papa, at Mr. Moke sucking a bottle. Yet Kostial still bore the scars of chimp resistance, as he proclaimed, "There is nothing more dangerous per pound than an angry chimpanzee."</p>
