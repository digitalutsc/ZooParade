<h2>Safari Park (1959-1970s)</h2>

<p>Far from downtowar, there is a new zoo and a whole new way of looking at animals. Your grandparents looked at animals in cages. Your parents gazed at them in open enclosures. Now you can hop into your car and drive outside of San Diego...and into the African Veldt.</p>

 
<p>The animals will roam free and visitors will be protected inside a monorail.Imagine yourself on a colonial era train as you gaze across the seemingly free herd of zebras and a giraffe pair.</p>

><p>In San Diego the zoo had begun dreaming of a safari park in 1959 in the midst of the era of African independence. The 1,800-acre site of the new Wild Animal Park was due to open its gates in 1972. Even before the park opened, visitors leaned against their cars at a highway turnoff to gaze at hundreds of animals, including a herd of white rhinos. "Just like South Africa â€“ just like Kruger," marveled some visitors as they got into their cars for their drive downhill to San Diego.</p>

<p>Meanwhile in Africa, trappers began to collect the park's animals. The zoo tried, when possible, to collect those animals overpopulating Africa's game reserves. It was not that Africa's elephant populations were soaring. Rather, they were concentrated in smaller and smaller realms, hemmed in by humans. Good game management in Africa meant that some animals headed for California. The rhinos were collected in South Africa from herds overpopulating the Umfolozi Game Reserve.</p>

<p>You can read the countless news stories and magazine spreads describing how San Diego, Africa and Asia have returned to savage splendor. Land movers formed the ground into new vistas and helicopters dropped spools of wire fencing; it was truly remote. Waterholes where herds of animals would soon gather burbled up from dry ground, fed by underground pipes.</p>

<p>When visitors arrive at the wild animal park it looked like wild Africa as seen in the movies. However, it looked nothing like a modern and free continent. In the safari park, zebras raised clouds of dust as they galloped in a panicked retreat. In the zoo's publicity, they looked great deal like those herds featured on film and television.</p>

<p>In the safari park, 'Nairobi' was still the gateway to safari country.  Yet it wasn't a growing independent capital with a large migrant population, but rather just off the parking lot, Nairobi was a village of primitive architecture and gift shops.</p>

<p>Visitors could purchase handicrafts from Asian and African artisans at the "International Shopping Bazaar."</p>
