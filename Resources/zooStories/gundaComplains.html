<h2>Gunda Complains (1904-1915)</h2>

<p>Take the subway to the Bronx Zoo. Its 1904 and you are eager to see the Bronx Zoo's latest prize. The zoo is still very young and the buildings are new. The zoo's first director William T. Hornaday is still assembling the animal collection. Now he has brought a rare beast to New York. The elephant Gunda has just arrived from Assam, the northeast corner of British colonial India. Like so many other children, you are eager to climb onto the elephant's back and ride in his howdah, the ornamented riding platform. Maybe you imagine yourself ambling through an Indian jungle. Or tracking a tiger on shikari, the Indian colonial hunt.</p>

<p>Maybe, though, Hornaday should have translated Gunda's nickname before he paid out the princely sum of $2,500. In Hindustani, Gunda meant villain, a foreshadowing of the crisis to come.</p>

<p>The first American zoos needed their elephants, like Gunda, because these large and popular animals helped to distinguish zoos from simple menageries. Elephants were also a novel source of income. Visitors typically paid their admission, and then ran to see the elephants. Sometimes they tossed peanuts, but just as often they wanted to go for a ride. In the early years of the 20<sup>th</sup> century the first American zoos depended on elephants to provide riding entertainment. Each morning keepers led their elephants into the open air and strapped on the howdahs. When the zoo gates opened the children arrived with pennies in hand, and they lined up to ride the elephant, just like a hunter or some colonial official in faraway India. The zoo even sold a colored postcard advertising the thrill of riding Gunda.</p>

<p>However an angry elephant, and they were often angry, could be a zoo's undoing. Many elephants had come to zoos after long careers at circuses. Literally castoffs from the big top, they had been fired from circus work because they became too old or too ornery. Other elephants, like Gunda, had come to the zoo directly from the wild when they were very young.Gunda had arrived in America direct from India with Hassan Bey, a native animal handler who was going to teach Gunda how to take a howdah. Bey, though, was worried. He had spent enough time with elephants to realize that Gunda had a mean streak. That relationship between elephant and human quickly soured, and Hornaday sent the native handler home. Hornaday hoped that the zoo's own keepers could handle Gunda more successfully.

<p>Gunda quickly became a star attraction and a novel source of income, and for a while the elephant's training seem to work. Between 1904 and 1909 Gunda seemed to accept the howdah and the receipts flooded in. The zoo didn't seem to mind that the elephant had occasional fits of anger. </p>

<p>When he tore up zoo benches, it just seemed to be a bit of humorous elephant energy. However youthful exuberance turned into grown-up angst and soon Gunda was retired permanently from his riding career. In 1914 Gunda tried to kill his keeper Walter Thurman for the first time. Luckily for Thurman, Gunda's massive tusk smashed in the dusty ground and he was able to scramble to safety. Gunda sparked a public debate about the challanges faced by early 20<sup>th</sup> century zoological gardens. If the only way to display the angry Gunda was through chaining and caging him, what is the point of having a live animal at all? Why not just put a stuffed elephant on display -- just as the impressario P.T. Barnum had done with the famous Jumbo? One morning a poem appeared that was attached to the bars of Gunda's cage. No one was quite sure who wrote the poem, but the keepers claimed to newspaper reporters that it was Gunda himself grieving his condition. Either way, the poem remained up for visitors to examine. "Lord, save me from my friends!" it read. Gunda added his own drama to the mysterious poem when he managed to loosen one of his chains and then immediately ripped the poem from the bars and trampled it into shreds. Gunda continued his violent rampage. He simply refused to be a specimen or a star at the zoo, and he ultimately met his fate when leading taxidermist Carly Akeley was contacted to end the elephant's life with a single shot. After Gunda's tragic end his skin was mounted for the American Museum of Natural History. Even after death Gunda remained on display for American visitors.</p>
