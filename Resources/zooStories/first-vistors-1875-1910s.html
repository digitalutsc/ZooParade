<h2>The First Visitors (1875-1910s)</h2>

<p>Visit the zoo at the dawn of the 20th century. Ther promised animal houses aren't even yet complete and many of the cages, meant for lions, tigers, or hippos, aren't yet filled. The plantings alongside the walkways are still young, but the guards angrily remind you to stay on the pathway. You've dutifully purchased a guide to the zoo when you entered the ornate entrance gate. But with all its dry language about genus and species, it doesn't really excite. Sometimes it just more fun to reach inside the rhino's cage, like these two girls at the Philadelphia Zoo. </p>

<p>What was it like to visit the nation's first zoos? How were the animals displayed? Did visitors and animals alike live up to the expectations of zoo boosters?</p>

<p>By the dawn of the new century, a few of the nation's biggest cities had built zoos, including the first zoo in Philadelphia. Other cities, like St. Louis, were eagerly laying plans for their very own zoos. Boosters regarded these first zoos as an integral part to any modern city. In fact, American elites looked to major cities in Europe and their collections of animals as templates for building American zoos.</p>
<p>But there was a right way to visit the zoo. Arrive. Buy a guide like this one from the Bronx Zoo.</p>

<p>Make sure that you are well dressed. Don't litter. The guide was clear in the directions it gave visitors: learn the biological taxonomy of the animal kingdom. Study the animals but don't feed them, or touch them.</p>

<p>The zoo guide was a kind of biological textbook for the public. It was a dry read that mixed scientific names with fragments of data about the lives of animals and their habitats. Inside the zoo, these animals lived in cages. The crammed surroundings and metal bars served a purpose, as they made the animals easier to study for their physical form undistracted by any kind of natural behavior. Guidebooks were full of rules and zoos were meant to be orderly places.</p>

<p>This is a picture of the ideal zoo as boosters in Philadelphia imagined it. The visitors are well dressed, strolling between cages to marvel at the order of nature. </p>

<p>For those elite founders who bankrolled the nation's first zoos, biological order and the strict classification of animals into kingdoms, genus, and species, was meant to produce social order. Pay attention, imagine yourself a scientist, and see if you can spot the difference between these two types of monkeys.</p>

<p>Or, examine different types of sheep from the guide to the Bronx Zoo. </p>

<p>The problem was that was not how the public wanted to experience their zoos. Visitors did not come to study or to learn the nature of taxonomic science. They paid their fares on streetcars and paid the gate admissions, so they expected something in return. They wanted to interact with the animals. Sometimes they wanted to tease, but just as often they wanted to feed. These bears in Philadelphia are begging for treats from their pit. </p>

<p>American visitors were far from the orderly and attentive students that zoo founders desired. They interacted with animals in ways that infuriated zoo directors and boosters. Visitors tossed food, teased the specimens, and left behind their trash. Visitors established their favorite animals, rushing past a grazing zebra to the powerful elephant. In New York, they insisted that the Barbary lion had his own non-scientific name. He was "Sultan" and he was not just an example of his species. He was a zoo star.</p>

<p>Animals also refused to act like mere specimens as they lashed out, refused their feed and even attacked their keepers. Animal resistance and visitor independence meant that zoos, meant to display the order of nature, had become disorderly places. Maybe that is why visitors came by the millions to still unfinished places.</p>
