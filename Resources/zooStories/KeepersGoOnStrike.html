<h2>Keepers Go on Strike (1940s-1960s)</h2>
<p>You can't visit the Bronx Zoo today. In April 1961, the zoo gates are closed and padlocked. Normally, the Easter weekend was one of the busiest of the year. This year, it was closed because the keepers are on strike. </p>

Newspaper reporters still hurried uptown. There were still attractions to see, such as snakes on a picket line. Zoo workers were walking the picket line and they brought a few of their animals with them. Sheep dutifully walk in circles, and the monkeys clamber to the safety of their handler's heads when they see the snakes. "Care for animals. Dignity for employees," read their signs. The labor conflict at the Bronx Zoo was a long time in the making.

<p>Imagine what it would have been like to work at the zoo. Zoo work was hard, and often times dangerous. As late as the 1960s, zoo workers were typically paid at the same scale as other municipal and unskilled workers. Labor conflict at the Bronx Zoo had begun in the 1930s, when workers first organized a labor union. The uprising at the zoo was part of the wave of labor organizing that swept the country during the Great Depression. Others zoos also confronted strikes. </p>

<p>Bronx Zoo officials had little patience for collective bargaining. Both its administrators and its donors were among the city's moneyed elite. Zoo officials responded after the first wave of labor organizing with a mixture of steady improvements, pay conditions and also threats . Zoo workers were targeted, disciplined, even fired. Quietly, the zoo sent spies to union meetings. The war interrupted the labor battles at the zoo as numerous keepers found their way into the armed services. Yet it was a truce, not labor peace. After the war labor conflict began anew. After a short strike and negotiations that seemed to go nowhere it was clear to both sides in the Bronx that a climactic strike was on the horizon. Zoo officials insisted that a strike at the zoo was very different than a strike at an automobile plant. Machines could sit idle, but what about living animals? The labor conflict changed focus from pay and conditions to animal care.</p>

<p>When on that April morning in 1961 strikers were walking the picket lines with animals, some keepers remained on the job. The union had struck an initial deal with the zoo; as long as the zoo did not try to open to the public, keepers would continue to feed and care for the animals. It was a landmark agreement that took into consideration the continuity of care. Hospital workers in New York City would use this same type of agreement in the coming years when they went on strike.</p>

<p>The strike at the Bronx Zoo was fascinating to the public and to newspapers, but it was not a unique phenomenon. In fact, virtually every major American zoo between the 1940s in the 1960s was the site of intense labor organizing and tumultuous strikes. The zoo workforce (as many people work for zoos today as for Chrysler) is still heavily unionized. Zookeepers also organized a professional organization: the American Association of Zookeepers.</p>

<p>The nature of zoo work was changing in the United States. During the turn of the 20th century zookeepers wore soldierly uniforms and came from former places of employment like circuses or the military. A few had been attendants at insane asylums. By the end of the century however, zoos brought in workers with professional degrees to accommodate the shifting mandate of the institution. The work of zookeepers became associated with the task of caring for endangered species.</p>
