<h2>Order at the Zoo: Scientific Lessons in Biology and Taxonomy</h2>

<p>During the turn of the twentieth century, zoos were seen as an integral part to any modern city. In fact American elites looked to major cities in Europe and their collections of animals as templates for building American zoos. As zoos became more integrated into American metropolis landscapes, scientific and zoological societies were eager to communicate and display lessons of biology and taxonomy to visitors. In fact quite often people are unaware that American zoos were created through the ambitions of scientific and zoological communities, which hoped to establish zoos as educational institutions. However American visitors were far from the orderly and attentive students that zoo founders hoped for, because they began act and interact with animals in ways that intellectual elites did not expect. Daniel Bender explains in his book how, "Zoo founders imagined their parks as orderly, but visitors and animals together ensured that they were anything but" (Bender, 5). For instance people would throw food at the animals, they would try and touch them, and animals acted disorderly in forms of resistance to their captivity. As America moved into the era of Depression, zoos became less about scientific lessons and more about family entertainment.</p>

<h3>Entertainment at the Zoo: Anthropomorphizing and Intimacy</h3>

<p>
This shift is partially due to the fact that private societies and elites were not willingly to financially support zoos any longer. Consequently the idea of a "modern and free" zoo emerged, with open spaces, no cages and public funding. As zoos became less about scientific lessons and more about family fun, the way animals were presented and related to audiences also changed. As zoos became more concerned with entertainment, animals were given names and anthropomorphizing qualities so humans could relate to them more intimately. This can be seen in the extensive use of animals as forms of entertainment, whether it was riding an elephant. watching the chimpanzee show, or watching a trainer feed the animals. Each new activity brought visitors closer in proximity to the animals in captivity. However sometimes people felt too comfortable around the caged animals, as some visitors would put their hands through the cages and lean over the bars of an exhibit. Of course in a few cases these actions would be fatal for some visitors, and it was through these dangerous interactions that Americans were reminded that the animals on display were still dangerous and wild. Although many animals had been given cute names, assigned personality traits, and were trained to perform acts, they were still wild animals at heart, and visitors were reminded of this whenever the tiger showed his fangs or when the elephant charged his cage bars. Thus the dangerous interactions that occurred between animals, visitors and zoo keepers can be understood as the animal's resistance to their captivity.</p>

<h3>Conservation at the Zoo: Breeding Programs and Preservation</h3>

<p>
A final shift occurred in the mandate of zoos after World War II, and this is because as colonies began to gain independence, anxieties about animal preservation and conservation took on an imperialistic tone. In fact American intellectuals of the animal community began to blame Native communities abroad for not taking proper care of their diminishing animal populations. Of course this accusation was quite unfair, as American and other Western powers had been taking animals back to their countries from these Native lands for quite some time now. Nevertheless, the people of the newly independent colonies were still blamed for not taking care of their animal populations. With this in mind, zoo officials consciously began to take up breeding endeavors and began to focus more on animal conservation in general. As the zoo community worked together to initiate breeding between animals in captivity, the zoo was effectively shifting its focus from entertainment to preservation. Furthermore as zoos became more crowded within the environment of cities, visitors sought a more serene experience out of the city. As zoos were beginning to emphasize conservation above all else, and as visitors desired a more natural experience, this led to the birth of the Safari Park. Safari Parks were constructed as naturalistic environments outside of the city, where visitors could drive their car through a simulated African landscape. From scientific lessons in biology, to family fun entertainment, to conservation and preservation initiatives; it is important to recognize that zoos have multiple layers of development that are affected by the historical circumstances of the time.</p>

<h3>The Experience of Zoos: Animal's Perspective</h3>

<p>
From the perspective of animals in captivity, their journey begins when they are captured in the wild. After they are captured they are put onto a boat and shipped across the Atlantic to arrive in America. Once in captivity, they would have frequent contact with zoo keepers who clean their cages, feed them and attend to any other needs. After the animal has settled, it will be put out on display for visitors. This experience must have been extremely overwhelming for wild animals who had rarely any contact with humans in the wild, let alone massive crowds of noisy people.</p>

<h3>The Experience of Zoos: Visitor's Perspectives</h3>

<p>
From the perspective of zoo visitors, their journey begins as soon as they enter through the zoo gates. There is most likely a map which shows visitors the different geographical regions as well as where the animals are situated. A day at the zoo could include such activities like feeding the animals peanuts or watching an animal performance. Through zoos, visitors were able to see many exotic animals that they would have never imagined being this close too. In this way, the zoo acted as an affordable means for Americans to travel the world without actually going across the ocean. This is why the geographical representation of other areas of the world are important in zoos, because American visitors would build knowledge about those regions based on what they experienced at the zoo.</p>

<h3>The Experience of Zoos: Zoo Keeper's Perspectives</h3>

<p>
From the perspective of zoo keepers, their journey may begin as soon as a new animal is brought into their institution. Zoo keepers often workers very closely with animals, through feeding and cleaning, and keeping an eye on their condition in general. Sometimes zoo keepers would do demonstrations with animals, feeding time, or washing time for visitors to watch and enjoy. Also, zoo keepers had protests and strikes just like many other workers during the first half of the twentieth century in America. Working conditions, issues over better pay and better training, led some zoo workers to strike as they picketed with animals upon their shoulders. Furthermore, for quite some time women were excluded from working in zoos because it was understood that they did not have the physical strength to perform certain tasks. Although women were able to work in zoos eventually, at first it was considered a male domain. In addition to this, many zoo keepers actually relied on their wives to take baby animals to their homes while the zoo was on strike. or if they did not have the proper accommodations at the zoo for baby animals. In fact there are many cases where zoo keeper wives housed and cared for baby lions, chimpanzees and other animals within their small apartments.</p>
