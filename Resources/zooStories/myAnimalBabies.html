<h2>My Animal Babies (1940s-1960s)</h2>

<p>On the front page of the local newspaper, there is exciting news that that lion cubs were born at the zoo last night. But read further; all isn't well in the animal family. The cubs are adorable, but the lion mother has refused to feed her young cubs. It's just after World War II and Americans are more focused than ever before on hearth and home. After World War II, families are on the American mind -- even if those families are cross-species families. The newspaper laughingly reports that the cubs will be taken home to a new mother: one of the keepers' wives.</p>

<p>As the war ended, many Americans (especially white Americans) moved out to the suburbs to new homes and began to raise families. Seeking to reap the rewards of World War II service and saving, they gravitated towards the security of hearth and home. Yet there are new worries on the horizon. The Cold War had many Americans anxious about national security and fears of atomic catastrophe. The nuclear family seemed like a bulwark against global insecurity. However, what did the Cold War mean for animals and their babies, like this mother and baby gibbon?</p>

<p>In the midst of an Amercan baby boom, the global animal trade was in steep decline. The public also seemed interested in the exploits of wild adventurers and their tales. Instead, the domestic seemed more comforting than the exotic. There were fewer animals left in the wild to capture, and even fewer for sale in the animal markets. Thus zoo officials came to rely on animal babies to excite zoo visitors, and to provide longevity for their institutions. Instead of new arrivals coming from jungle to zoo, Americans were eager to see, touch, and cuddle zoo babies.</p>

<p>This love for animal babies meant different experiences for the animals and for the human women who were often expected to care for them. Too often, the American obsession with the nuclear family meant that zoos grouped animals with mom, dad, and baby. However, this model did not work for many animals, and just added new stresses for animals that were trying to raise their young in front of jostling crowds. Still, zoos delighted in telling stories about animal families and jokingly compared animal and human mothers. When captive animals could not raise their own young, zoos sometimes described them as indolent. When babies were rejected or orphaned, zoos turned them over to keepers' wives.</p>

<p>Babies frequently went home with keepers, and the newspaper reporters followed. In a Cold War era when Americans were so focused on family, images of wives caring for animal babies made for good press. The baby chimpanzee Oofy was destined for the stage at the St. Louis Zoo, but his time in the public limelight began when he went home to be cared for by Mrs. Frank Floresek, the wife of one of the zoo's keepers. Whether Oofy liked it or not, he was going to be raised like a human baby.</p>

<p>The idea of animal adoption as an essential strategy for zoos had begun. The labor of women helped identify a new method of animal care that focused on mothering and nurturing animals for their survival. Many women stepped in to take care of baby animals whenever their natural mothers failed or rejected their babies while in captivity. Wives of zoo officials became important in rearing and providing care for these animal babies, some even taking baby leopards, chimpanzees or lions to live in their urban apartments or suburban homes.</p>

<p>Earlier zookeeper work was viewed as manly and brave labor; it was work with dangerous animals. Yet as zoos became more focused on conservation, zoo work became increasingly more focused on maternal work, such as helping with childbirth and raising babies.</p>

<p>Belle Benchley, the executive secretary at the San Diego Zoo, cuddled leopard cubs for the cameras, highlighting the new world of zoo nurturing. </p>

<p>She was a zoo pioneer. And, she bottle fed a tapir.</p>

<p>As the very first woman to direct a major American zoo, she often described herself as a zoo mother and her animals as her babies. She knew what the public expected of a woman working in the zoo. Other women slowly found their way into zoo employment, a world that had once been firmly closed to them even during the labor shortages of World War II. Although females were able slowly to find work within zoos, they still performed work that was associated women's domestic labor. Sometimes they cared for zoo babies. Other times they cared for human kids in children's zoos. Caring, nurturing, patience and motherhood all came to define women's zoo labors.</p>
