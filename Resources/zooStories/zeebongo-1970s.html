<h2>Zeebongo! (1970s)</h2>

<p>Fred J. Zeehandelaar was one of the world's busiest animal dealers in the 1970s. Although the life of animal dealers was not as exciting as it once was during the time of Frank Buck, Zeehandelaar was still proud of his busy days in his Long Island office shuffling customs and quarantine forms from the inbox to the outbox. He ran to the airport to receive wild cargo, then dashed home to phone a zoo to beg for a past due payment. It wasn't exactly the dramatic life of a wild animal dealer about which Frank Buck had once boasted. Hardly the jungle adventurer in colonial Malaya, here is Zeehandelaar meeting a new animal arrival still in its crate.</p>

<p>The American Association of Zookeepers invited Zeehandelaar to give a talk at its 1972 annual conference. He praised the hard conservationist work of zookeepers. He told the keepers that they contributed greatly to species survival. He also shared a few inside jokes at the expense of zoo directors. What really did they do anyway, when all the husbandry, feeding, breeding, and feces shoveling was done inside the enclosure by keepers? But, what about the animal business in which Zeehandelaar was making its career? How did that business fare in an era when the idea of endangered species was on the minds of Americans and their lawmakers?</p>

<p>Zeehandelaar was an animal importer, a businessman, not an adventurer. 'Zeebongo' wasn't a wild 'jungle call' or an exotic foreign word; it was his telegraph handle. It was how customers could reach him when, for example, their elephant was lifted off of its boat.</p>

<p>In the 1970s, the American public was more divided than ever before in their opinion on zoos. Critics of zoos merged together to form new organizations that today continue to challenge the ethics of keeping animals in captivity. In fact many of the arguments for phasing out the zoo advanced in the 1970s still ring familiar today. Zoos often responded to these concerns with inflated statements about their role as the foundation for animal conservation. Advocates like William Conway, now the director emeritus at the Bronx Zoo, claimed zoos in 1977 as the "repositories of some irreplaceable living treasures." Given changes in animals' "homelands," whether high in the Himalayas or deep in the jungle, "there will be no other way of preserving them." The zoo was not a prison or even a naked cage; it was a sanctuary and animals were portrayed not as specimens or commodities, but refugees. Was this giraffe arriving in New York, a valuable zoo attraction or a refugee from a troubled continent?</p>

<p>Zeehandelaar had gone into the animal business at a time when zoos could no longer simply buy and sell their animal specimens. In 1963, the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) launched deliberations that eventually produced the Convention on the International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES). The American Endangered Species Act of 1973 turned the provisions of CITES into American law.</p>
<p>Zeehandelaar was one of the first convicted of breaking the new law. Soon after the law was passed Zeehandelaar faced indictment, as he was accused of illegally transporting endangered species. Zoo directors, keepers, and Zeehandelaar knew very well that there was nothing particularly clean about the animal trade. Sometimes illegally collected apes moved from one country to another; for example from Indonesia to Singapore, and received a whole new set of papers. It was animal laundering of the worst kind. At the end of the age of empire and at the dawn of a new era of mass extinctions, the animal trade had entered the shadows and, no matter how much Zeehandelaar protested his innocence, he found himself in trouble. In Zeehandelaar's case, he was desperate to import cheetahs before the Endangered Species Act came into effect. In one of the first prosecutions under the new law, Zeehandelaar was accused of backdating the documents on the import order.</p>
<p>
He was found guilty, fined $5,000, and spent three months in jail. Zeehandelaar's commodities were "living, breathing creatures destined to educate the public about life in the animal world," or so he justified his business. The problem was that by the 1970s these were endangered commodities, and the public was beginning to think about them less as the dangerous prizes of the abundant jungles and more like the last loveable specimens of dying species.</p>
