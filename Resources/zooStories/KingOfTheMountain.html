 <h2>King of the Mountain (1930s)</h2>

<p> You are worried about your job. It's the height of the Great Depression and unemployment remains high. Maybe you work in a factory. Shifts have been cut and workers laid off. Some of your friends, family, and neighbors are now dependent on relief jobs created by the New Deal, the Federal work programs advanced by President Franklin D. Roosevelt. A few years ago, after the Wall St. Crash, you just didn't seem to go to the zoo often. The cages looked and smelled unpleasant and, truthfully, the zoo didn't seem worth the price in uncertain times.</p>

<p>But, now, in the midst of the New Deal, you have returned to the zoo to see the exhibits built by relief workers. Your friends and family have built a new modern zoo and its open enclosures seem like the perfect escape from the stresses of bad times.</p>

<p>Why did so many Americans visit the zoo during the Great Depression?<p>

<p>There are good reasons to visit the zoo in the midst of an economic crisis. For those with even the smallest amount of pocket money, the zoo was a cheap way to escape an industrial city plagued with unemployment, trading it for wild jungles or savannas. Also, during the 1930s American zoos were more exciting than ever before. The stodgy, didactic focus on biological taxonomy had given way to child centered entertainment.</p>

<p>At first, zoos had suffered with the downturn of the Great Depression. Animal specimens aged, buildings reeked with the stench of urine and decay, and repairs were left undone. However, New Deal planners realized that zoos were the ideal focus for urban relief. What better way of showcasing the benefits of putting the unemployed back to work? From Toledo to San Francisco to New Orleans, some of the largest urban New Deal projects rebuilt decaying zoos. Unemployed workers paid by relief programs painted murals, carved sculptures, designed new buildings, and produced new entertaining zoos. Tearing down cages, New Deal zoo designers advocated open enclosures where visitors, especially children, could imagine the animals in the wild and toss them peanuts or candy.</p>

<p>Where did the new designs come from? Designers often looked to German zoos especially the Stellingen Zoo, which was owned by the famous Hagenbeck animal-trading firm and had long experimented with the use of open enclosures. Zoo designers were especially excited about the showcase attraction of the German zoo: the monkey mountain.</p>

Remarkably, they used salvaged materials from closed industrial buildings. </div>


<p> Towering above a moat, the artificial rock provided ledges for hordes of monkeys to play or, more likely, to engage in desperate struggles for space and dominion. Here was the perfect way of introducing the new entertainment zoo. New Deal supported workers constructed monkey mountains across the United States. In places like Lansing, Michigan, and other smaller cities, the monkey mountains were more humble affairs.</p>

<p>In larger cities like Cleveland, monkey mountains were jaw-dropping attractions. Sometimes hundreds of monkeys climbed over the islands, which rose to astonishing heights. Visitors loved the new attraction of monkey mountains as they flocked to the New Deal zoo.</p>

"They have a wonderful zoo here," scrawled the visitor on the back of the card. </div>

<p> However life was not easy on monkey mountains. In the interest of entertainment and admission fees, zoos placed far too many monkeys onto the islands and, as a result, struggles for dominance became much more severe. </p>

<p>When winter came, they were herded into crammed indoor cages and mortality rates were high. In at least one zoo, directors resorted to putting only male monkeys on display even if it increased the violence between them. Public monkey mating was just too much to show visiting children. However monkey fights were considered acceptable zoo entertainment.</p>
