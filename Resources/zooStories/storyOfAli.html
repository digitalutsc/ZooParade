<h2>The Story of Ali (1920s-1930s)</h2>

<p>At the New York World's Fair in 1939, she have rushed to watch the parade leading to Frank Buck's Jungleland. The elephants are decorated and majestically march through the fair grounds. Frank Buck is perched onn top of the largest elephant. Johnny Weissmuller, the "Tarzan" star, is setting next to him. You are just as fascinated by Ali, Buck's loyal assistant who sat below him on the elephant's shoulders.</p>

<p>Wherever there was Frank Buck, Ali seemed nearby, sometimes in fact and sometimes in fiction. Ali was an employee and a poorly paid one at that, but Buck needed him. Buck required Ali's knowledge of both animals and language in his business dealings. For his films and stories Buck needed a loyal sidekick in the form of a subservient native. The image of Frank Buck as a manly and authoritative animal adventurer depended on Ali, as Buck situated Ali into the role of a loyal servant and colonial subject. </p>

<p>Of course, when Buck pictured Ali, for example, in a comic book, he appeared as a loyal servant, dressed in an exotic costume. Here in garish red clothing and an Orientalist fez, Ali brings water for the master's wash. </p>

<p>Frank Buck had worked alongside some of his native employees for years, but he still viewed them through racial lenses. "I have always employed native boys," declared Buck, and he was convinced that they needed only meager pay. "[T]he cost of native labor in the jungle countries is very cheap," but wants of little beyond "fish, rice, and sarongs." Yet they had a natural "knowledge of animals…and native customs." Natives' low wages, he argued, were merely subsidiary to their natural gathering and subsistence from the jungle. Though his highest paid assistants earned no more than 6 to 12 straits dollars a week, and most of them earned less than half of that, they were considered "loyalty itself" by Buck because he was able to both control them and rely on them. Buck needed Ali not just for his ability to speak some of the many languages of Southeast Asia and his knowledge of local habitats, but also as a valuable sidekick in his stories.</p>

<p>Without a "Number One Boy" Buck would have been lost in the jungle business and perhaps dead in real life, because Ali once saved Buck's life from an angry tapir. He also needed him as he weaved exotic stories about native animals and exotic peoples. In fiction, at least, Buck cast himself as a manly hero because he mastered both tropical nature and peoples.</p>

<p>In these souvenir playing cards, both wild animals and peoples seem strange:</p>

<p>Buck's gun, pith helmet, and jungle suit contrasts with the dark skin and grass skirts of his native employees.</p>

<p>Ali played the most prominent role in Buck's stories as the link between Buck, the modern trader, and the mystical Orient. In Buck's narration, Ali helped his master understand both exotic races and wild animal nature. Here Ali comes running when Buck calls. Together they penetrate the lush jungle.</p>

<p>As a translator, Ali spoke English and could converse in some of the various languages of Dutch and English that colonial subjects spoke in British Malaya and Indonesia. In Buck's stories through broken English Ali pledged his dedication to Buck. Ali was portrayed more like a servant that was awed by his master's courage rather than a worker. In Buck's telling, Ali said, "Tuan, there big chance of success for man like you in my country...I work for you always – hard – and in future until I die." For the comic book version of <u>On Jungle Trails</u>, Buck illustrated Ali's devotion as they struggled to feed an emaciated elephant calf. The elephant climbed on Ali's back while the standing Buck demonstrated his ingenuity in crafting a bamboo feeding tube. The imagery was easy to understand: Ali provided strength and loyalty, even when it placed him below the animal. Buck permitted Ali little role in devising captures and rebuked any unwillingness or resistance. For example in one case Buck snapped at Ali and said, "You do what you are told," when Ali doubted that Buck could shoot a branch from under a snarling clouded leopard.</p>
