<h2>A Jungle Business (1918-1930)
</h2>


<p>Between the two world wars, you are walking through the expansive city zoo. You pass by the big cat cages or, maybe, the elephant enclosure on the way to the bird house with its din of calls and screams. Don't spend too long admiring the multicolored plummage. After all, you want to get to the reptiles before the zoo closes for the day to gape at the poisonous snakes from India and the giant python that has just arrived from Malaya. Maybe you are still a young child. Likely, you are visiting with your parents and somewhere between the big cats, the birds, and the reptiles, you ask the obvious question: "how did all these strange animals get to our zoo?"</p>

<p>Animal traders like Frank Buck liked to tell their American audiences that they had captured the animals they sold to American zoos alive in the heart of dark, dangerous jungles. The reality was that Buck and so many others like him never penetrated the jungle because they simply did not need to. Like other tropical commodities that became so valuable in the age of empire, from rubber to tin, animals were available in urban markets.</p>


<p>When Buck, whose specialty was bringing back alive Asian animals, went in search of big cargo to bring back to American zoos, he went to Singapore. He checked in at the Raffles Hotel, Southeast Asia's most luxurious hotel, and then went hunting for animals in the the city's animal markets. Buck rarely ventured into the jungle as many of his stories suggested, but rather he purchased already captured animals from local merchants. Here's Buck cuddling a tiger cub. He wanted his readers to believe that he had caught this animal in the wild. More likely, he bought the animal in the comforts of Singapore. </p>

<p>If you wanted to try your luck in the animal game between the two world wars, heavy metal animal traps would do you no good. Instead, you needed good skills at bargaining and somebody to help you translate from English into one of Southeast Asia's many tongues. In Singapore, especially along its Rochore Road, animals are crowded into small shops and colorful birds are held in rattan cages. Here was just one of Singapore's many animal shops. This one mostly sold birds. </p>

<p> Further down the road a store might be selling a tiger or its cubs. Orangutans were more rare, but you could still buy them. Ships arrived in Singapore from Indonesia, Malaya, and even farther affield with wild cargo. Ships like these unloaded their animals and sold them to ethnic Chinese traders who, in turn, sold their animals for export to traders like Buck. Sampans Moored at Singapore WaterfrontSingapore's markets, small shops, and busy port supplied by one estimate, about one-half of the animals that filled the world's zoos.</p>

<p>How did this collection of animals make its way from the jungle to an Imperial port?</p>

<p>The story begins in trading relationships that long predated Frank Buck. Perhaps hundreds of kilometers from Singapore, local villagers might snare a colorful bird or a rare mammal or poisonous snake.</p>


<p>After a few days in a cage bumping along jungle trails to the local port, the prize specimen might catch the attention of a passing Chinese merchant. Such merchants with their home base in Singapore had, for many years, traded along the islands and coasts of Southeast Asia and Indonesia. In the years before Buck set up his business in Singapore, such traders had gone into the animal business. Between the two wars this was a thriving trade as animals moved from forested interiors to nearby ports and from there, to Singapore's port and then to its shops. From there...to your hometown zoo.</p>
