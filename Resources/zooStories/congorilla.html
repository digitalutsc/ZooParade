<h2>Congorilla (1930-1932)</h2>

<p>In the late fall of 1931, a pair of gorillas were finally on their way to a American zoo. In San Diego the newspapers are filled with details of their train trip across the continent from New York, and people are excited to be among their first human visitors. These gorillas had become celebrities before they could even arrive in San Diego. Gorillas were rare zoo attractions and they seemed to represent, for many Americans, the essence of primitive Africa.</p>

<p>In 1930 the nature filmmakers and adventurers Martin and Osa Johnson went to the Congo in search of gorillas. Gorillas were still uncommon in American zoos. The Johnsons had an idea for a new film involving gorillas that was sure to be a hit. For the first time they were going to record the real sound of African game lands. Of course, the film promised dramatic shots of lions, thundering herds of wildebeests, and wallowing hippos, but the real draw was the captivating footage of pygmy humans and gorillas.</p>

<p>Both pygmies and gorillas fascinated Americans. Gorillas were rare and short-lived attractions at American zoos. They tended to live only a short time in captivity, often a matter of days before they died. Zookeepers often thought that they died of melancholy, but in reality, zookeepers understood very little about what they needed to do to keep the big apes alive. An African pygmy, named Ota Benga, had also been put on display in an American zoo. Benga had been a star attraction at the 1904 St. Louis World's Fair and after the fair closed, he traveled to New York City where he became a controversial exhibit at the Bronx Zoo. Visitors certainly came to see the African human, but his intentionally placed exhibit alongside the apes and the racist overtones of his display launched a public controversy. African-American critics protested the overt racism of an African man on display, and keepers complained about the chaos when 40,000 people crowded the zoo to see the "wild man from Africa."</p>

<p>Ota Benga was still fresh in the American mind in 1932 the Johnsons spent a few months in the jungle revealing to Americans the lives of pygmies and gorillas. They brought along with them the most up-to-date cameras and their racial ideologies. The Johnsons spent a few months in the pygmy villages, and their film shows them laughing for the camera as they measured pygmies' diminutive height. </p>

<p>Their expedition continued further into the Congolese jungle and up the mountains to the habitat of the gorillas. The Belgian government, the colonial rulers of the Congo, had given the Johnsons permission to collect just one gorilla. Instead, the Johnsons went home with three.

<p> Despite the anger of both the Belgian colonial government and American gorilla conservationists, the Johnsons were intent on selling the gorillas for a profit. They were certain, despite the economic downturn of the Great Depression, that some zoo or circus would dig deep and pay for a popular attraction.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the Johnsons put the three young gorillas that they had captured on display at New York's Central Park Zoo. They also added a special attraction: two African men that they had hired in Nairobi to care for the young gorillas. The enthusiastic crowds, excited by the soon-to-be-released film, flocked to the zoo as interested in the African humans, Manuel and Diosaner, as in the African apes. Reporters and visitors delighted in the oddity of two Africans in the city. The elevated railway and the Empire State Building frightened the "congenial little boys," according to one racist report. Electric lights "one of civilization's greatest miracles â€“ to these boys" fascinated them. Martin got the idea for a publicity splash; he would bring the two young men up to Harlem to see the tall buildings and to listen to jazz. The racism of two African men sleeping alongside gorillas and on display at the zoo caused an intense controversy. Soon African-American political leaders, including some associated with Garveyite organizations, protested the humans' treatment. Pan-Africanist activists in Harlem traced very different interpretations of their connections to Africa. Histories of slavery and colonization, not evolution, chimps, or gorillas, linked Americans and Africans. New York activists turned the Johnsons' savage spectacle into a labor struggle. After Martin's tour of Harlem, a group of angry Harlem women marched on the zoo and the Native African Union of America appealed to the British Consul. The handlers, after all, were British imperial subjects. Later, the union provided a lecture stage in Harlem for the two Africans to speak. They demanded that the men should be paid union wages and lodged in hotel.</p>

<p>The Johnsons realized that the publicity stunt had backfired and they sent the two men home. Meanwhile they had no buyers for the gorillas and with the controversy the Johnsons realized that they could not sell the gorillas to a circus where they would be displayed as oddities, rather than scientific specimens. They had to keep up at least a pretense of scientific enthusiasm. One gorilla soon headed for the National Zoo, and died shortly thereafter.</p>

<p>, of the country the director of the San Diego Zoo, Belle Benchley, was eager to display the two remaining gorillas, named Ngagi and Mbongo. Benchley not only wanted the gorillas for her zoo (still threatened by the Great Depression), but she also wanted to reach out and touch the gorillas. She longed to run her fingers through their hair and to turn the division of species into ties of affection. Manuel and Diosaner handled the gorilla, but Benchley could care for them as a white mother cared for her children. "I am trying definitely to make friends with them," Benchley said. As much as she worried about their loneliness, she also craved an "intimate closeness with the Johnson's Black Babies," as she called them. </p>

<p>Ngagi died in 1944, two years after Mbongo. Benchley was particularly affected by his death from Valley Fever, scientifically known as <em>Coccidioides immintis</em>, which is a fungus native to the American southwest. It was likely that he caught the disease from an infected clod of mud hidden inside his hay. Valley Fever mimicked tuberculosis and Mbongo wasted away in front of Benchley's eyes. She reached through the wire to the dying ape to "lay my hand on the huge black one." Briefly, their eyes met and she knew, as he moved "the cold hand on which mine rested," that she would not see him again. Certainly, his death was a loss to science, but Benchley considered him as a "a grand entertainer" and "a rare friend indeed."</p>
