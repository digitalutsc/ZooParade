<h2>Ziggy and George (1940s-1970s)</h2>
<p>In 1941 when visitors went to the Brookfield Zoo, they gaped at Ziggy, the zoo's largest elephant named. Ziggy had come to Chicago's biggest zoo from circus life and brought with him a reputation for defiance. The zoos' officials realized early on that they needed an experienced hand to care for such a dangerous animal. Over the long history of American zoos, they knew that an angry male elephant could be deadly.</p>

<p>They turned to George "Slim" Lewis who had made his name in circuses as an animal handler capable of taming even the most irritable elephants. Lewis, meanwhile, was looking forward to settling down in a single city after following the itinerant routes of circuses. Eventually the zoo decided that Ziggy was ready to breed and they ordered Lewis to introduce him to the zoo's female elephants. Lewis was worried. He knew better than anyone else how elephants bred, and he recognized that a sexually frustrated male elephant like Ziggy could be especially dangerous.</p>

<p>So, on April 26, 1941 standing in front of Ziggy's enclosure you might have seen Ziggy attack his keeper.  Ziggy turned and charged and before Lewis could flee, Ziggy had pinned his keeper's arm to the ground. He stabbed with his tusks and tried to gnaw Lewis' leg. Lucky for Lewis though, Ziggy's final stab buried his tusk in the dirt and this gave Lewis a chance to scramble to safety. Another horrified zoo visitor snapped a picture of the moment when Ziggy attacked Lewis.</p>

<p>Ziggy spent almost the next three decades enchained inside the elephant house. Then in the 1960s, in an era when visitors were especially concerned about the state of captive animals, they began a campaign to free the elephant. The zoo built a new house and a new enclosure. Then, George Lewis traveled back to Chicago to see Ziggy being led outside. Despite their struggles, Lewis loved that elephant "as a man would love a wayward son or brother." When the zoo finally let Ziggy wander outside in 1970, Lewis was there to lead him into the yard. Why did Lewis return to Chicago? Why had he pled for the life of the same animal that had tried to kill him?</p>

<p>This was a relationship defined by a lack of knowledge. Could elephants truly thrive in captivity? When were they ready to breed? The reality is that Ziggy and George "Slim" Lewis were caught in the middle of this misunderstanding, and as a result Lewis almost lost his life, and Ziggy would spend much of his life chained up inside. </p>
