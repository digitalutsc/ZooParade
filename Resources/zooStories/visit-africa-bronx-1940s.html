<h2>Visit Africa in the Bronx (1940s)</h2>


<p>Visit Africa...in the Bronx. The herding animals have gathered around the waterhole in the shadow of the African village and in the dwindling sunshine of the African sunset.</p>

<p>They are wary; lions are watching them from a rocky perch.</p>

<p>On the eve of World War II, the Bronx Zoo helped ordinary New Yorkers visit Africa's animals. The new African Plains exhibit dispensed with its cages. Instead, dramatic open air enclosures and groupings of multiple species tried to reproduce the savage splendor of Africa's game lands for American visitors. </p>

<p>How did the African Plains exhibit help transform the zoo visit? </p>

<p>With exhibits like this one, American zoos turned away from dry science lessons to offer more entertainment and a more natural-seeming experience for visitors. They discarded cages for new wide-open spaces. Moats kept the animals captive instead of metal bars.</p>
<p>Africa was closer than visitors thought. Reedbucks, bushbucks, and nyalas meandered down the slope to the water hole under the keen gaze of  lions perched on a rocky outcropping. The new "African Plains" exhibit imported "a Spot of Africa" and announced a new era of zoo design that depended on visitors' imagination and thirst for adventure travel. African animals  herded into a "game-abounding open terrain," at least as it existed in the domestic tourist's mind. The zoo played on the double meaning of recreation: as both the pleasurable communing of urban inhabitants with live animals, and re-creation, as the representation of faraway lands.</p>

<p>As zoo directors shifted their focus from scientific study to entertainment, and took down cages and replaced them with open-air exhibits, zoos became increasingly family friendly destinations with plenty of activities for children. They could, for example, buy food to feed the animals. Seeing the animals wasn't a science lesson anymore. It was tropical adventure for the whole family.
