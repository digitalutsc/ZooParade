<h2>How to Capture Elephants in Ceylon (1920s-30s)</h2>
<p>The newspapers were filled with exciting headlines that new animals were coming to the local zoo. The prize specimen was an elephant, fresh from the jungle. As people rushed to the zoo to be among the first visitors, it is easy to imagine their questions. How do traders capture wild animals, asked one children's book.</p>

<p>Zoos and circuses all wanted to display elephants. But how could one animal trader trap a herd of elephants, let alone bring them back alive?</p>

<p>The story of one elephant hunt during the 1920s on the island of Ceylon, a British colony (now the independent nation of Sri Lanka), reveals the inner workings of the tropics' strangest business. In fact, the animal business had two sides, the first involved the actual capture of animals later for sale, and the second was selling the story of the capture because Americans were fascinated by jungle animals, native peoples, and travel adventurers.</p>

<p>Capturing large animals, whether elephants or tigers or orangutans, took labor and lots of it. Frank Buck once told, and sold, the story of how he captured elephants in Ceylon. The island's jungles were thick and they harbored not only sizable human populations but also ample herds of elephants. If Buck was going to capture elephants, first he needed to hire humans. With the help of local translators and middlemen, Buck sent out word that he needed workers, hundreds of them to build a giant kraal deep in the jungle.</p>

<p>A kraal was an enclosure for animals usually made from mud, branches, or other types of fencing. Workers hacked at towering trees to clear space in the jungle, and then built a fence tall enough and strong enough to hold back a panicked elephant herd. Then, he hired beaters armed with noisemakers and torches to direct the frightened herd towards the kraal's opening. Once inside, they slammed the wooden gates shut. The elephants were angry and confused. With trunks, tusks, and their heavy bodies they hurled themselves against their enclosure. At least one worker lost his life. Finally, with the help of other trained elephants, Buck and his workers selected the elephants they wanted to keep.</p>
<p>Over the next few days and weeks, those captured elephants may have slowly become accustomed to their new life of captivity. But as Buck and other animal traders realized, it was one thing to capture animals; it was quite another to bring them back to the United States alive. Captive animals had to be walked, sometimes carried, sometimes dragged to the nearest port. From there they were carried to a colonial port, likely Singapore, and then loaded onto a ship for the transpacific journey. Life on board the animal ship was uncomfortable at best, fatal at worst. Mortality rates were always high, and on one particular occasion Buck's ship ran into a Pacific typhoon. He watched helplessly as crates of animals slid into the sea. Even in calm weather, animals endured high temperatures and overcrowded conditions. Sometimes they escaped, other times with predators packed next to prey, stressful conditions became fights. As Buck's animal treasures either died from stress or were swept off into the sea, he had learned the hard way the lesson of the animal trade. That is, Buck learned not to count on profits from the selling of animals alone. So, he turned the story of an animal capture into an illustrated book for sale.</p>
<p>It was also a story of other exotic jungle oddities. He included two photos of the 'wild men of the jungle'. One photo of a jungle-dweller, part of a tribe of "genuine wild men," appearws twice. First in close-up, he demonstrates how to shoot a bow with his legs. "They have long, bushy hair and beards. Like monkeys they can use their feet almost as well as their hands," Buck explained. A few pages later, Buck with his hand close to his gun, towers over the squatting tribesman.</p>

<p>Even the youngest reader would have understood the message: Buck was lucky enough that while capturing wild beasts, he encountered the strangest, wildest savages as well. In the search for elephants in the jungle, Buck realized that the most profitable endeavor was selling stories about wild animal capture and encounters with so-called savage people to the American public. This was how Buck managed to turn an elephant adventure into a Camel cigarette ad.</p>
