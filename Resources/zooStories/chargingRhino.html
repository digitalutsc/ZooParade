<h2>The Charging Rhino (1950s-1960s)</h2>

<p>In the 1950s as you watch the lions sleeping on their concrete rocky outcropping or the cheetahs pacing in their cage, you might imagine yourself in wild Africa.</p>

<p>In the safety of the American zoo, the mind leaps to Africa. What would it be like actually to watch these beautiful predators stalking their prey in the wild? The rhino at the zoo calmly munches hay, but his horn and armored sides hint at a hidden power.</p>

<p>Once it seemed that African wild abundance would last forever. However after the end of World War II, American zoo conservationists realized that they were living at the dawn of an age of extinction for many species. As American audiences worried about the fate of Africa's wild game after independence, another popular genre of film emerged to satisfy Americans' thirst to see wild animals before they were lost forever.</p>

<p>Cotlow had made his name as a tropical adventurer, saving up money from his job selling insurance to travel throughout Africa in particular. Cotlow was concerned with capturing the dynamic moments of wild animals' lives in their natural habitat on film. He wanted to capture their moments of fierce defense of vicious attack. When the animals grazed or slept, he turned off the camera. In order to create his iconic scene in "Zanzabuku" when the rhino charged his jeep, Cotlow admitted to provoking the rhino into a charge. Chrysler, the film's sponsor, must have been delighted with proof that their jeep was resilient enough to withstand the ravages of an angry, charging rhino. Cotlow recognized that American audiences craved the violence of the African bush, as well as the reactions of animals under stress. He had uncovered the secret of the successful animal film: grazing zebras or wildebeests were less exciting than a vast herd in a panicked stampede.</p>

<p>While Cotlow's rhino charged, the world was changing. Even the rhino might have recognized the changes when empire gave way to independence. More hunters, tourists and filmmakers than ever before crowded the South African veldt, eager for a last colonial safari experience before independence. There were also fewer rhinos than ever before. "Zanzabuku" at once excited and comforted American audiences still insistant that Africa should be a primitive wildlife paradise. But Africa was on the verge of independence and while Cotlow was busy filming, Kenya was in revolt. He arrived at the tense eve of the Mau Mau rebellion. Cotlow filmed animal captures, but he also turned the cameras off in the midst of wartime.</p>

<p>"Hatari!" starring John Wayne, from 1962 also featured charging rhinos. The film was supposedly set in Kenya, although it was actually filmed in neighboring Tanganyika, which was still under British rule. Yet the film presented a vision of an effective and benevolent imperial regime, and also an allegory of the family of white empires. The film featured a spotless hospital, a saloon called the "Safari Bar," Indian grocery store owners, and a British game officer protecting an African village from a rogue elephant. Wayne played Sean Mercer, an American animal collector, who deliberately recalled Frank Buck. He was assisted by a team of white adventurers, happily nestled in the bosom of a British colony. In addition to Wayne, the animal collecting team included a French soldier of fortune, a German racecar driver, and a Brooklyn taxi driver. The American Indian was horned by a rhino in the pre-title action sequence and, with his leg injured he reverted to the familiar film role for American Indians: the wise seer, warning of the future peril and offering advice.</p>

<p>Wayne enjoyed the glamorous role of roping fleeing game. But Africans were the first off the jeeps and in danger's way, and they were the ones who dragged the animal to its cage. On film, the Africans labored in total silence, and their silence is noteworthy. It signaled not only their supporting role in the white trapper's late colonial adventure but also their supposed compliance to Wayne's leadership. African silence was broken when black characters became tourist objects as part of local landscape. Black employees make sounds only during the opening titles when they used the top of jeeps for drumming. After all, what would a film in Africa be without native drumming?</p>
