<h2>White Man's Conquest (1920s)</h2>

<p>In the 1920s, do you dream of making a fortune in the animal game, the buying and selling of wild animals?</p>

<p>Before World War I, the animal trade was a big business that was dominated by German companies, especially the Hagenbeck animal trading company. But after the war ended it seemed as though the market was wide open, and some Americans tried their luck in the animal business. Ordinary Americans could 'play the animal game' by staying home and reading about the adventures of others as they went looking for animals in Africa and Asia. Wynant Hubbard was one American who took his chances in the animal game. Here's Wynant and his family perched on baby elephants in southern Africa.</p>

<p>Hubbard went to Africa after World War I to make his fortune capturing animals to sell to zoos. By any financial reckoning, he was a failure. He came home a few short years later, broke, sick, and divorced. Still, when he sat down to write his first memoir of life in the animal game in Africa he entitled it <span style="text-decoration: underline;"> A White Man's Conquest.</span> During his time in Africa, Hubbard tried unsuccessfully to catch and sell animals from snakes to hippos. Sometimes he bought specimens from local indigenous peoples and then kept them in cages waiting fruitlessly for a buyer. Sometimes he even went into the bush to track his own animals. He posed proudly next to a buffalo that he had shot on the veldt. For some Americans hunting in Africa, this might have just been a trophy. But Wynant was trying to make a living with live animals. This buffalo was a sign, not of hunting success, but of failure in the animal game.</p>

<p>Why did Hubbard still see himself as a conquering white man, even though his effort to capture animals was so unsuccessful? Hubbard's failure and conquest is a story of guns, animals, meat, business, and racism in the heart of European colonies in Africa. Due to British colonial game laws that severely restricted native gun ownership, Hubbard was the only one permitted to use a firearm on his expeditions. Whenever it came time to stop a charging animal, Hubbard was the one with all the power. Natives weren't allowed to fire the guns on the dead buffalo.The animal trade brought white Americans into close contact with black Africans, who were subjects of European empires. These were relationships that were born out of violence against both animals and people, monitored by empires, and laced with racism. Wynant Hubbard later described his total failure in the animal game as a white man's conquest. But, was it really a conquest?</p>

<p>Native peoples had the knowledge and skill to track the animals Hubbard was seeking, and they also had motives of their own when they agreed to work for him. Whenever Hubbard killed an animal like that buffalo rather than sending it back to America alive, the animal's meat was distributed to the native workers. As they were not allowed to use firearms, meat was a rare and precious commodity. So, native workers would use flattery to convince Hubbard that he was indeed a great hunter. Subtly, they profited from his hunting exploits with payments made in meat.</p>
