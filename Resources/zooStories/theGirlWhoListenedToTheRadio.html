<p>Many Americans would have seen his films, and maybe even visited one of his animals, like Harry, the famous and rare Asian rhino housed at the St. Louis Zoo. </p>

<p>Fans of Buck could write to him in hopes of receiving a signature Frank Buck sundial or replica pith helmet. As children fantasized about jungle adventures and hoped to gain a piece of that action. What lessons  did the popular culture of animals teach Americans about the tropics?</p>

<p>Young Mary L. Shike sent in a Pepsodent carton to receive her official Frank Adventurers' Club handbook.</p> 

<p>Mary used its adventure map to follow the "Bring'Em Back Alive" man during his Pepsodent-sponsored radio program. With Singapore at the bottom of the map, the Malayan peninsula covered much of the two-page spread. On the left hand side, squeezed Ceylon and its elephants, and Nepal and its rhinos.</p>

<p>This was  Buck's view of Asia. With the sole exception of Singapore, Frank Buck's Base Headquarters, everything had been returned to savage jungles, tribal peoples, and animals. Five nights every week, Buck spun radio yarns that for all their fiction had become familiar adventures to zoo visitors, film audiences, and all those children like Mary, who sent in Pepsodent cartons. Here is Buck bravely trapping Harry the Rhino.</p>
