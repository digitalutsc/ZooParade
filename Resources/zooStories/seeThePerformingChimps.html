<h2>See the Performing Chimps! (1930s-1970s)</h2>

<p>Visit the St. Louis Zoo anytime between the 1930s and the 1970s. There are many famous attractions to see from the bear pits, a pioneering example of open zoo enclosures, to the celebrity animals, like Harry the rhino. For a while, the zoo even boasted a giant panda.</p>

<p>More than any other animals, visitors went to watch the chimpanzees. Visitors are headed to the chimpanzee show arena.</p>

<p>Especially in the summer for decades thousands of visitors have come to watch chimpanzees ride bicycles or donkeys. They chuckle at apes in costumes or, playing the piano. </p>

<p> They marvel at acrobatic feats. One star, Poncho, rode a decorated tractor. </p>

<p>Why were chimpanzee shows so popular?</p>

<p>The chimp show arena at the St. Louis Zoo was one of the largest performing spaces in the city. In fact the number of St. Louisians and tourists that paid every year to see the performing chimps is comparable to the number of people who paid to watch the Cardinals play baseball. "Monkey Moneshines," read the caption on a picture of the area. </p> 

<p>During this time period if you are seeking a St. Louis celebrity, look for a chimpanzee. Perhaps the chimp stars were wearing a Native American headdress.</p>

<p> Or, a zoot suit.</p>

<p>In the 1930s, chimpanzee stars wore boxing shorts. By the 1950s, they dressed up like Liberace.</p>

<p>Zoos like those in St. Louis needed their chimpanzee shows. Others zoos, like the Detroit zoo also featured performing chimpanzees. <p>

<p>Extremely popular, these shows generated crucial funds even during the Great Depression when times were tough. Performing chimpanzees had a long history in the United States dating all the way back to the turn of the 20th century. In fact, the very first chimpanzees in North America were dressed up in top hats and smoked cigars. In New York, Baldy posed for a souvenir postcard with an American flag. </p>

<p>Vaudeville, the popular stage variety shows that dominated American theaters in the first decades of the 20th century, regularly featured performing chimpanzee acts. Moreover, these were not sideshows but headlining acts. Some of the most popular performing chimpanzees of the era such as Joe Mendi earned salaries (for their owners) that often dwarfed those of human stars.</p>

<p>Chimpanzee shows were difficult work for performing vaudeville apes and zoo animals. They were coerced, bribed, or beaten into postures and unnatural behaviors. Chimpanzees just don't ride covered wagons.</p>

<p>For human audiences, chimpanzee shows took their place along other kinds of acts, such as blackface minstrel songs, that turned everyday racism into entertainment. Vaudeville promoters delighted in comparing their performing apes to African humans. At a time when Americans were debating the science of evolution, chimpanzee shows featured apes doing every day human activities such as drinking from a cup or riding a bicycle. Such acts laughingly depicted chimpanzees as the missing link between people of African origins and the great apes. In fact in Dayton, Tennessee in 1925 when the teacher John Scopes was put on trial for teaching the theory of evolution and the national press gathered, the famous chimpanzee Joe Mendi arrived dressed in formalwear and held court outside the trial.</p>

<p>As vaudeville declined in favor of films beginning in the 1920s, chimpanzee shows moved from the stage to the zoo. Soon performing chimps and their acts had become a mainstay of zoo entertainment and an integral part of the zoo visitor's experience. Also, zoos desperately needed the gate receipts from these popular chimp shows. Chimps were stars, at least until they grew up and refused to work.</p>

<p>Chimps' physiognomy was familiar enough to imagine their gestures and behavior as human-like pleasure, but not so human that the difficult show business tasks they performed seemed degradingly hard labor.</p> 

<p>As chimpanzees aged, many trainers found it even harder to convince or force chimps to ape humans for entertainment. Publicity described the star of the Detroit chimpanzee show Jo Mendi as a joyous performer: "Once his audience shows the proper appreciation, he works furiously skating wildly about the stage." In truth, Jo Mendi resisted his labor violently. His trainer Theodore Schroeder often appeared with bandaged hands from Jo Mendi's bites. The second Jo Mendi was just as violent. Once his show had to be stopped mid-act when the chimp drew blood from his keeper. After this incident, the ape soon retired from the stage.</p>
