<h2>Saving the Bison (1880s-1910s)</h2>

<p>It's 1905 and you are visiting the Bronx Zoo. In other visits you gazed at the lions or tigers. Today, you are visiting one of the last stands of American bison before they head west again..</p>

<p>At the Bronx Zoo,visitors had the opportunity to watch bison peacefully grazing in their paddock.</p>

<p> The zoo's director William T. Hornaday felt especially connected to the zoo's bison herd. They were all at once a source of pride, an emblem of Hornaday's suspicion of the general American public, and an enduring symbol of the zoo's conservationist credentials. How did the Bronx Zoo try to save the American bison?</p>

<p>Avid hunters like the wealthy Madison Grant had help found the Bronx Zoo. In fact, the zoo displayed hunting trophies in its famed heads and horns collection. The bison became the focus of a different kind of zoo campaign, one that was focused on preservation and conservation as well as criticism of American hunters from more humble backgrounds. This new type of campaign still began with a hunt.</p>

<p>Long before Hornaday came to the Bronx Zoo, he had made his name as a hunter and as a taxidermist. From 1878-1880, Hornaday hunted in South and Southeast Asia shooting, preserving, and later stuffing tropical big game. Back in America, the last great bison herds were falling in a hail of bullets. In 1887, Hornaday travelled west in search of the last few bison specimens to shoot and mount in a dramatic diorama for the National Museum in Washington DC.</p>

<p>As Hornaday scanned the American plains for bison, he knew that he was hunting in a graveyard.</p>

<p> "Where the millions have gone," he said. Hornaday saw bison bones everywhere he went, and yet he was still dedicated to his "last buffalo hunt." He blamed the death of the depleting herds of bison, and other animals including songbirds, on poachers and riffraff. Hornaday firmly believed that the bison slaughter in America embodied the overrun of nature by the masses, ungoverned by morals or the rules of "fair chase" hunting. At the National Museum, he mounted his own hunting trophies, a memorial of sorts to the millions gone. </p>

<p>By 1905, as the director of the Bronx Zoo, Hornaday collected a sizeable bison herd from their last stand in Yellowstone. He assembled the Bronx herd in order to restore them to the Great Plains. Hornaday and the zoo pleaded with the Federal government to fence the Wichita Forest range in Oklahoma. In return the zoo promised to donate eighteen of its own animals. Saving the bison at the zoo married the hunt to conservation.</p>
