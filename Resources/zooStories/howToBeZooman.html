<h2>How to be a Zoo Man (1940s-1950s)</h2>

<p>If you visited the New York World's Fair in 1939-40, you probably lined up outside Frank Buck's concession, Jungleland. With its towering monkey mountain and its fanciful reconstruction of Buck's Malayan animal trapping camp, Jungleland looked nothing like a standard zoo. You could buy a souvenir lasso, sample Malayan satay, or chuckle at Buck's stage set candlesticks with their faux elephant tusks and monkeys wearing Southeast Asian garb. MISSING IMAGE

<p>How did Jungleland present a new way of exhibiting animals and introducing foreign peoples? And how did zoos present their own form of wild adventure to compete with exciting figures like Frank Buck?</p>

<p>Frank Buck won the concession for displaying animals at the World's Fair in the massive Queens fairground, and the nearby Bronx Zoo was worried. Zoos were dependent on the animal traders, but they also feared them. By the late 1930s, animal traders actually had become competitors to zoos. Buck's Jungleland promised wild adventure, like the kind that was experienced through his films. Zoo officials realized that Buck was offering exaggerated popular entertainment. However, the zoo still needed a hero to compete with the sensational animal trader.</p>

<p>They needed a zoo man, someone to demonstrate to Americans the reality of the animal world. So Bronx Zoo officials offered the more evolved zoo man, one that would study animals alive rather than "Bring 'Em Back Alive." The Bronx Zoo's William Beebe was lean and gangly compared to Buck's muscular heft. He was learned and scientific rather than blustery and boastful. He was the zoo man and an able answer to the Buck's jungle adventurer.

<p>Ironically, William Beebe got his start in the zoo world from William T. Hornaday. Beebe, by contrast with Hornaday, sought to open the zoo gates to all and turn the drudgery of animal observation into exciting stories about science in the wild.

<p>After a torturous experience on the Western Front during World War I, Beebe retreated to the jungle and began writing books, like his 1918 book <u>Jungle Peace</u>. He introduced an interested public to the character of the zoo man. The big game hunter killed and the animal trapper brought animals back alive. The zoo man watched animals in their natural habitats helped American audiences witness the hidden dramas of the animal kingdom. Beebe was not concerned with fabricated jungle brawls, but rather with the unseen trials of army ants or the courtship of birds.</p>

<p>Beebe was an unlikely celebrity, in marked contrast with Frank Buck. Yet there he was in New York at the World's Fair sharing the same exhibition as the Bronx Zoo's rare giant panda. Beebe had founded the zoo's tropical research station and observed jungle animals from Costa Rica to Venezuela. He had traveled in a specially outfitted boat to the Galapagos Islands, and descended into the Bermuda deeps. Here was a new way of interacting with tropical nature better suited to the nature of zoo exhibits. There were no violent brawls or dramatic hunts by large predators in Beebee's accounts. Instead, Beebe was teaching the American public to watch and appreciate the natural behaviors of wild animals. From inside the tropical research station, Beebe could watch'em alive. So could visitors at the zoo.</p>

<p>A fellow Bronx Zoo keeper, Raymond Ditmars even wrote a novel about how to observe animals properly. His novel, <em>Forest of Adventure</em> published in 1933, was a subtle jab at the forced drama of stories produced by Martin and Osa Johnson or Frank Buck. Ditmars focused his story on the search for insects and giant armadillo along the Demerara River in Guyana. These were hardly the dangerous predators that Buck had taught Americans to enjoy.

<p>In Ditmars' account, the most dangerous peril scientists faced in the jungle was their own clumsiness, and a lurking bushmaster snake. Rather than fanciful playing cards, the zoo man provided scientific diagrams.
