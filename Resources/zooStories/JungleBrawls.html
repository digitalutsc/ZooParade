 <h2>Jungle Brawls (1934)</h2>
<p>The tiger's ripping claws tore into the crocodile's tough hide. His fangs latched onto the reptile's shoulders, but the battle is far from over. The croc's massive, powerful jaws dwarf the tiger. It was the kindof battle that probably never rent the peace of the jungle.</p>

<p>Frank Buck began his career in Chicago's theaters but gave up the theatrical life to become an animal trader. Later he returned to entertainment as a filmmaker. He provoked jungle brawls and called it nature. Even in black and white, the jungle seemed alive and rife with wild dangers -- at least when Buck filmed it. In addition to this, Americans were excited by the epic battles between jungle predators that came to life on movie screens. Did anyone believe that the fights were real? Or, was they just nature faking? Armand Denis, a young film director, would find out first hand what went on behind the scenes of these popular jungle films.</p>

<p>Armand Denis was the film director who traveled with Frank Buck to Singapore to film "Wild Cargo." When he posed alongside Buck, Denis admired Buck as one of the "heroes of America." </p>

<p> By the time Denis went to Singapore, Buck was already the nation's best-known animal adventurer and filmmaker. The film-going public was thrilled to see the rare footage of animal brawls. </p>

<p>It was all very exciting, and Buck portrayed all the events as if they were real. Buck also borrowed liberally from another popular film genre of the day, the gangster film. Deep in the heart of the Malayan jungle, Buck called tigers jungle gangsters. As the camera panned across the towering trees and massive palm fronds of the Malayan jungle, Buck's solemn voice admired its beauty and solitude, yet warned that underneath the glorious canopy there was danger that creeps, and death that crawls.</p>

<p>Maybe Denis truly expected that filming with Frank Buck was going to be an adventure deep in the jungles, or maybe he was in later years trying to protect his own credentials as a nature photographer. But Denis was disappointed when Buck staged an epic fight with a man-eating tiger. The tiger was not a wild man-eater at all, but rather a mangy and domesticated specimen that Buck purchased from a local Singapore shop. In fact the tiger died during the filming by drowning in a pit during a sudden downpour. Undaunted, Buck wrestled its corpse to capture the films most talked-about scene anyway.</p>

<p>"Animals don't normally fight to the death," Denis laughed when Buck proposed a fight between a tiger and an orangutan. "When I'm around they do," Buck replied. One delighted Atlanta reviewer raved that the fight in "Bring 'Em Back Alive" between a thirty-foot python and a tiger, "is the most thrilling thing of its kind ever recorded." As Buck staged violent fights between animals for audiences back home, his fabrications contributed to the popular imagination of exotic jungles as dangerous and wild places. </p>
