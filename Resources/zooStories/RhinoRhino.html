<h2>Rhino, Rhino (1948)</h2>

<p>After World War II it became harder for zoo officials to acquire animals for their collections. Colonies that once provided zoos with a steady stream of specimens were now independent nations. So, how did zoos collect new animals during the era of decolonization ? If the animal trade had introduced Americans to life in colonies, did it also offer a commentary on the independence?</p>

<p>The war is just over, but the struggle for independence in Asia and Africa is at its height. India and Pakistan have become new nations and the Brookfield Zoo in Chicago is eager for Indian rhinos. Ralph Graham was the assistant director of the Brookfield Zoo and he was tasked with for bringing back alive a breeding pair of rhinos from newly independent India. </p>

Here's one of them wallowing in mud.</div>


<p>Before the war, when the St. Louis, Bronx, and Philadelphia Zoos sought Indian rhinos, they commissioned Frank Buck who negotiated with colonial officials and relied on the knowledge and muscles of local workers to both capture and transport individual animals. Now Graham and his zoo begged the newly formed Indian government for permission to remove a breeding pair of rhinos from Kaziranga, the rhino reserve in the remote reaches of Assam.Graham was off on a "once in a lifetime adventure" and he sent home a tourist memoir about animal encounters during the chaos of independence. Graham had little to tell his audience in Chicago about the actual capture of the rhinos. In fact, he was not even present when the second rhino tumbled into a muddy pit trap. Rather than dangerous animals, the biggest perils he encountered were the bloated bureaucracies of independent India, the supposed laziness and superstition of native workers, and the corrupt merchants. He narrated a comedy of errors in which Graham, the intrepid tourist, negotiated monsoons and airplanes that detoured miles out of the way to avoid flying over East Pakistan (now Bangladesh). Graham described India as a nation condemned by its infernal weather, primitive technology, and corrupt peoples. For instance, Graham described how local craftsmen haphazardly completed the traveling crate that he had carefully designed. Then they were asked to rebuild it, this time under Graham's constant supervision. Also his truck driver, "Fatso" as Graham referred to him, had mysteriously misappropriated gasoline rations.</p>

<p> Graham navigated India without the help of loyal assistants or natives equipped with the intimate knowledge of animals and their ways. Whereas Buck depended on his faithful assistant Ali, Graham hired Kashi Ram, a very different kind of worker. In fact, he would later name the male rhino after him, admitting he knew only two Indian names: Ram and Mahatma Gandhi. Ali knew the Malayan jungle by instinct. However Ram, like the new Indian forest officers, could not even pinpoint Kaziranga on a map. "</p>

He liked the zoo crowds at home but hated the way curious Indians surrounded the captured and stressed rhinos.</div>

Here they are at work. Some do the work. Others just stand around watching.  </div>

<p> The female rhino, Kamala Rani, was in a precarious state when Graham captured her because she was heavily pregnant. Maybe she should have been released to give birth back in the wild. Or, she could have been stabled in Assam until she gave birth. However, Graham wanted to escape a coming monsoon and sent her on the rough road and river ride towards Calcutta and then home to Chicago</p>

<p>Along the way, her calf was stillborn and Graham was furious. He had ordered round-the-clock supervision, but when she went into labor, her attendants were fast asleep. Graham described his extreme anger regarding the situation: "I was utterly sick, and almost to the point of uncontrollable fury."</p>
