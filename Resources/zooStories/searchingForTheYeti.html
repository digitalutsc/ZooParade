<h2>Searching for the Yeti (1960-61)</h2>


<p>In 1960, at the height of the decolonization, animals just don't seem particularly exotic anymore. Nearby zoos boast a comprehensive collection of animals like gorillas that would have been almost unknown to your parents or grandparents. However, there is still one animal might just grab your attention: the legendary yeti. And, Marlin Perkins and Edmund Hillary are beginning an expedition to the Himalayas to search for it. Wouldn't it be incredible if these two famous men could capture footage of the yeti and prove its existence? Maybe they might bring back one alive?</p>

<p>Marlin Perkins' beloved television show, "Zoo Parade," where he handled with animals at the Lincoln Park Zoo in Chicago and shared anecdotes about their behavior had just come to an end. After its popular national run, the show has finally been cancelled. Audiences still wanted to see more from Perkins.</p>

<p>What can a wild chase up and down high mountains for a yeti tell us about animal conservation at the end of the era of empire?</p>

<p>Perkins knew that audiences were restless, and he was looking for a new job and a new adventure. Perkins began his lifelong career in zoo work as a young man enthralled with the St. Louis Zoo, and eventually he became the zoo's reptile keeper. Then, he moved to Buffalo where he directed a zoo that was reconstructed under the New Deal. After Buffalo, he made his way to Chicago to direct the Lincoln Park Zoo and helped care for Bushman the famous gorilla. While in Chicago, he became a national celebrity with "Zoo Parade." By the end of the 1950s, "Zoo Parade" with its simplistic formula of walking around the zoo seemed tired and the show was canceled. Soon, a job opened up in St. Louis near his hometown and where his journey had begun. Even better, he would have the opportunity to design a new TV show called "Wild Kingdom," in which he and his assistants would have the chance to be the world's luckiest tourists. They would travel the world, meet conservationists, and film strange and endangered species. Perkins would introduce the show from a stage set that looked very much like a living room. His assistant would be one of the St. Louis Zoo's trained chimpanzees. His very first ape assistant was none other then Mr. Moke.</p>

<p>In the meantime, Perkins was given the opportunity of a lifetime. The World Book Encyclopedia was sponsoring an expedition to the Himalayas to look for the fabled yeti. Sir Edmund Hillary, who was one of the first two men to climb Mount Everest, led the expedition.</p>

<p>At first, the adventure seemed like so many other colonial era travels. In Kathmandu, Perkins wandered around the exotic city and in the evening he enjoyed a stiff drink and a European meal. Troubles began as they hiked into the thin air. Exhausted, Perkins shifted his load to his Sherpa assistant. He knew that stories of the yeti were important in the local folklore, but he was interested in science not fables. Once zoo adventurers and animal traders had depended on the local knowledge of their assitants, as Frank Buck had needed Ali. Now in 1960, Perkins was merely suspicious and he and Sir Edmund worked to debunk folklore as a hoax. First, they proved that a supposedly yeti footprint was just the melted print of a dog. </p>

<p>And proved that it was just sun melt enlarging the paw print of some smaller animal. Then, they removed a yeti scalp from a local temple and flew it back to Europe to be tested.

<p>Sir Edmund even tried it on.</p>


<p>Sir Edmund and his team climbed higher into the mountains with an experimental hut to prove that they could last the Himalayan winter, and Perkins went home to defend the significance of his trip. He had always been suspicious of yeti stories, he claimed, but what if the yeti had actually been real? It would have been a triumphal moment for the Lincoln Park Zoo if he had been able to come home with the last anthropoid ape. Bushman the gorilla had recently died, and the crowds certainly would have come back to see a yeti.</p>

<p>There is a air of disillusionment in Perkins' account of his yeti hunt. Perkins was a world traveler who cared deeply for the animals and admired conservationists, but he had come to distrust local populations. The hunt of the yeti revealed that Perkins, like other zoo directors at the end of the era of empire, believed he was saving endangered animals from the newly independent peoples. He and other American zoo officials worried that independent nation's wouldn't care for their animals. Here Sir Edmund posed with a supposed, mangy yeti hide. It is almost possible to hear the rest of the exhibition laughing.</p>
