<h2>Bring 'Em Back Alive (1932)</h2>
<p>In 1932 the Depression has set in and economic misery hangs heavily over American cities. There are breadlines, but there are also lines outside the movie theaters. You decide to head for the movies to watch the exciting adventures of Frank Buck, the man who brings animals back alive to zoo.</p>

<p>What better way to escape the Depression then a jungle adventure?</p> 

<p>The street was alive with the sounds of the jungle. Thousands had come to watch the year's most exciting film: "Bring'Em Back Alive."</p>

<p>The title was Buck's catch phrase, a folksy evocation of the exciting life of the animal trader. In reality, Buck had left behind the risky business of the animal trade and become one of the nation's most popular filmmakers. He offered true stories – or were they? – of how to bring back animals from Asia to American zoos. By the Great Depression, the animal business, like so many others, had gone from boom to bust and animal traders like Buck were looking for new kinds of work. Before he had gone into the animal business, Buck had worked in Chicago's entertainment and theater world. He was ready to move from buying and selling animals to selling spectacular stories of jungle adventure and animal capture. By the end of the 1920s as zoos were buying fewer animals for their collections, Buck returned to the world of entertainment and over the next decade he would make some of the most popular films in a new genre of animal pictures.</p>

<p>Films like "Bring' Em Back Alive" and "Wild Cargo" featured Buck playing himself: the jungle adventurer facing ferocious animals.</p>

<p>With vibrant images and hair-raising, although entirely staged, violent fights between the jungle's most dangerous animals, Buck's films were more than mere entertainment. They were a cultural phenomenon that marked Americans' fascination with the exotic jungle as well as the peoples and animals that lived there.</p>
    
<p>Buck had discovered the real profit in the animal trade. There was never much money in buying and selling animals, but there was plenty to be made selling jungle adventure. Buck was more successful than any of the other contemporary animal traders such as Charles Mayer, J. L. Buck (no relation to Frank), or Ellis Joseph in turning the animal trade, the buying and selling of tropical commodities, into a cultural industry of adventure stories. He soon moved beyond films and became a marketing celebrity. Almost always seen in public with his trademark pith helmet and jungle suit, the barrel chested Buck embodied adventurous American manhood as much as anybody else.</p>

<p>He lent his name to advertising through endorsing cigarettes, guns, tires, and even ham. He sold wildly embellished stories to the American public in the form of comic books, pulp fiction and through his lengthy dictated autobiography.</p>
